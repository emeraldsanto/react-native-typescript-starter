# react-native-starter
 A React Native boilerplate project using Typescript and React Navigation.
 
## Translation

This template comes with an extendable and efficient internationalization mechanism implemented using `Context`. To add more languages or translations, simply edit the `translations.json` file. By default, the supported languages are french and english.

## Themes

Also included in this project is the support for custom themes (as well as two default, see table below), also implemented with the `Context` API. To add more themes, simply edit the `themes.json` file. Here is a list of available `ThemedComponent`s:

- `Themed.Text`
- `Themed.LocalizedText`
- `Themed.Button`

All of which have a non themed version, if you ever need it.
